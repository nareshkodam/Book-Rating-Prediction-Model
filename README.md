# Book-Rating-Prediction-Model
My First ML Model: To predict the average rating of a given book.

## Predict the Average Rating of Books
In this project, we have worked on a books dataset published by Goodreads. The dataset comprised information/data on the following factors: Book ID, Book title, Authors and Co-Authors, Average rating, ISBN and ISBN 13, Language, Number of pages, Number of ratings count and Text reviews count, Publication date and Publisher.

A book lover before purchasing a book may prefer to consider one or more of the above mentioned factors with average rating, author, publisher being the most important ones.

With the onset of digital revolution, Goodreads as a platform is very popular amongst book readers. They prefer to look at the average rating and also the reviews provided by others.

For book readers like us, alongwith authors, publishers also play an important role. Publishers like Penguin, Harper Collin have always been associated with good books and hence play a very important role in determining the popularity of a book.

The objective behind building the model was to predict the average rating of a book based on various factors which play an important role in the determination.

This model definitely does not judge the books by their cover but by number of pages, language, publisher and author etc.


## Key Findings from the Data
From the Goodreads books dataset, we seek to find out the following:

1. What is average rating for most of the books?
2. In which year maximum books were published?
3. Does Publication date, number of pages, text reviews count and ratings count really have an impact on   the rating of the books?
4. Who are the top 20 authors and publishers?
5. In which language are most of the books read?
